# LLM Context Helper for Borderlands 4 Online Save Editor
# Last updated: 2025-09-25

## Project Overview
This is a web-based tool for decrypting, editing, and re-encrypting Borderlands 4 (PC) save files. It allows users to upload their `.sav` or `.yaml` files, make changes (either manually or via quick modifications), and download the updated save for use in-game.

## Key Features
- Decrypt and encrypt Borderlands 4 save files using AES-256-ECB with a key derived from the user's Steam or Epic ID.
- Convert between binary `.sav` files and human-readable YAML.
- Apply quick modifications such as removing map fog, unlocking locations, safehouses, SDU points, skipping story missions, and unlocking UVHM.
- All operations are performed client-side in the browser; no files are uploaded to a server.

## User Workflow
1. User selects a `.sav` or `.yaml` file.
2. User enters their Steam or Epic ID (required for encryption/decryption).
3. The tool decrypts the save and displays the YAML in an editor.
4. User can edit YAML directly or use quick modification buttons.
5. User downloads the modified save as `.sav` or `.yaml`.

## Technical Details
- Encryption uses AES-256-ECB. The key is a static 32-byte base key, with the first 8 bytes XOR'd with the user's Steam/Epic ID.
- Save data is compressed with zlib and a checksum is appended.
- PKCS7 padding is applied before encryption.
- Decryption reverses these steps.

## File Locations
- Windows saves: `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\My Games\Borderlands 4\Saved\SaveGames\<steam_id>\Profiles\client\`
- `1.sav`, `2.sav`, etc. are character saves; `profile.sav` is global state.

## Common User Questions
- How do I find my Steam/Epic ID?
- Why do I need my platform ID to decrypt/encrypt saves?
- How do I back up my saves?
- What do the quick modification buttons do?
- How do I remove fog of war or unlock all locations?

## Constraints
- Never upload user files to a server.
- Always recommend backing up original saves before making changes.
- Only support Borderlands 4 PC save files.
